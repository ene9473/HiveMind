## Usage Examples

### Problem Submission

```javascript
// Create new problem
const problem = await Problem.create({
  title: "Optimize Solar Panel Efficiency",
  description: "Develop algorithm to maximize energy collection",
  requirements: [
    "Must improve efficiency by 20%",
    "Handle variable weather conditions",
    "Real-time adjustment capability"
  ],
  bounty: {
    amount: "50000 DAI",
    deadline: "90 days",
    milestones: [
      {
        description: "Algorithm design",
        percentage: 30
      },
      {
        description: "Implementation",
        percentage: 40
      },
      {
        description: "Testing and optimization",
        percentage: 30
      }
    ]
  }
});

// Set validation criteria
await problem.setValidation({
  metrics: ["efficiency", "reliability", "scalability"],
  minimumRequirements: {
    efficiency: "20%",
    uptime: "99.9%",
    responseTime: "100ms"
  }
});
```

### Solution Development

```javascript
// Create solution branch
const solution = await Solution.create({
  problemId: problem.id,
  approach: "Machine Learning Based Optimization",
  team: ["user1", "user2"],
  repository: "solar-optimization"
});

// Submit milestone
await solution.submitMilestone({
  milestone: 1,
  deliverables: {
    documentation: "docs/algorithm.md",
    code: "src/optimizer.py",
    tests: "tests/efficiency_test.py"
  },
  results: {
    efficiencyGain: "23.5%",
    reliability: "99.95%"
  }
});
```

### Reputation Management

```javascript
// Update contributor reputation
await Reputation.update({
  userId: "user1",
  contribution: {
    type: "code",
    quality: 0.95,
    impact: 0.85,
    collaboration: 0.90
  },
  endorsements: [
    {
      userId: "user2",
      rating: 5,
      comment: "Excellent algorithm design"
    }
  ]
});
```
